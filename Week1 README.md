# Week1 with BWT

In the start it was a bit overwhelming in terms of understanding the tasks we would be given. Then we had a meeting with the lead of this course #humairshoukat and he explained every bit of the course and it made things easy to begin with. He explained and gave us the deep details and overview of the course. In the first meeting he explained of what flutter is and what is the benefit of it. He added Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google. It allows developers to build cross-platform mobile applications for Android, platform using a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which was also created by Google. I started as a beginner in this course and will strive to excel and become an active learner.
